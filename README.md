# Hi, I'm Jacob 👋

**Data Engineer and Software Engineer** working at the intersection of **GenAI, data platforms and security**.  
I build and ship **data pipelines, AI systems and cloud services** that run on **AWS, GCP and Azure**, and I break things on purpose as a **CTF player (Mayas, Crypto team)**.

---

## What I work on

- **Data and Cloud**
  - ETL and real-time data pipelines with **Python, SQL, Apache Beam, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Pandas**
  - Analytics and dashboards with **BigQuery, Looker, Data Studio, Tableau**
  - Services and apps on **AWS, Google Cloud, Azure**

- **AI and Conversational Systems**
  - Audio **sentiment analysis** and **image / video classification** with **Vertex AI** and custom pipelines  
  - Conversational AI with **Dialogflow, AWS Lex, Azure Bot Service, OpenAI APIs**
  - Frontends and APIs using **Node.js, Angular, React, Django, ASP.NET**

- **GenAI, LLMs and AI Security (Current focus)**
  - **Custom LLM workflows** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**
  - **Vector databases** and orchestration with **LangChain, LangGraph**
  - Prompt design, evaluation and hardening of **LLM-based applications**
  - **AI Security research**: prompt injection, data exfiltration and abuse of GenAI systems

## InfoSec and CTFs

- **CTF Player** at **Mayas** on the **Crypto team**
- Passionate about **OffSec, cryptography and challenge building**
- Founder and former captain of the **“Pirates of the Caribbean”** CTF team at Universidad del Caribe, promoting ethical hacking and security culture  
- Track record in CTF and competitive programming:
  - **HackDef CTF**: Top 10 (2020), Top 6 (2021), Top 3 (2022)  
  - **ACM-ICPC Latam**: 2017, 2018 and 2019 participation with an Honorable Mention in 2019

## Highlighted projects on this GitHub

Most of my production data / GenAI / security work is private, but here you can see part of my journey:

- 🎯 **[Codeforces](https://github.com/the1177/Codeforces)**  
  Accepted solutions to algorithmic problems. Reflects my competitive programming and problem-solving roots.

- 🎮 **[JuegosUnicaribe](https://github.com/the1177/JuegosUnicaribe)**  
  Game built with **Phaser 3** as part of a university project. My early work in game dev and interactive JS.

- 🧩 **[ProyectoTerminal-Frontend](https://github.com/the1177/ProyectoTerminal-Frontend)**  
  Frontend for a **gamified learning platform** for students and teachers, focused on engagement and motivation.

- 🌐 **[ProyectoFinalProgramacionWeb](https://github.com/the1177/ProyectoFinalProgramacionWeb)**  
  Final project for the Web Programming course, full web stack with **PHP**.

- 🗓️ **[Sistema_Horarios_Unicaribe_Front](https://github.com/the1177/Sistema_Horarios_Unicaribe_Front)**  
  **Vue** frontend for a classroom scheduling and management system.

These repos are mostly from my **university and early-career** years. Newer work tends to live in private/company repos (data pipelines, GenAI, security PoCs, internal tools, CTF challenges, etc.).
